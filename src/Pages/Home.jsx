            A fun and creative tool built with Go that converts images into
            ASCII art. This project demonstrates my ability to work with image
            processing libraries and handle data manipulation in Go. It includes
            support for customizable output dimensions, grayscale shading, and
            file export options for seamless sharing.

          <h3>REST API in Go</h3>
          <p>
            A robust and scalable REST API designed using Go and containerized
            with Docker. This project highlights my expertise in building
            efficient backends, including implementing CRUD operations,
            middleware, and database integrations. With Docker, the API is
            easily portable and ready for deployment across various
            environments.

              I participated in the Google Hackathon and secured the 3rd place
              with my team. We built a web application that helps users learn
              any African language of their choice. Using Google Cloud
              Speech-to-Text API, we were able to transcribe and translate
              spoken words into the selected language. The project was
              well-received by the judges and attendees, and we were awarded a
              cash prize for our efforts.

            <h2>My Journey to Software Engineering</h2>
            <p>
              I started my journey to software engineering in high school when I
              developed a keen interest in technology and programming. I began
              learning Python and building small projects to enhance my skills.
              As I progressed, I explored other programming languages and
              frameworks, expanding my knowledge and expertise in the field. I
              am now pursuing a degree in Computer Science to further my
              education and career in software engineering.
            </p>

            <h2>My Love for Chess</h2>
            <p>
              Chess has been a significant part of my life since childhood. I
              started playing chess at a young age and quickly fell in love with
              the game. I have participated in various tournaments and
              competitions, honing my skills and strategic thinking. Chess has
              taught me patience, discipline, and critical thinking, which I
              apply to my daily life and work as a software engineer.
